### Objectives

The objective of this project is to analyze the data from FoodHub, an online food aggregator service, to understand customer demand across various restaurants and cuisines in New York. This analysis will support FoodHub in enhancing customer experience and optimizing restaurant partnerships.

### Data Description

The dataset captures different aspects of food delivery orders. Each row represents a unique order with the following attributes:

- **order_id**: Unique ID of the order.
- **customer_id**: ID of the customer who placed the order.
- **restaurant_name**: Name of the restaurant fulfilling the order.
- **cuisine_type**: Type of cuisine ordered.
- **cost_of_the_order**: Cost of the order in USD.
- **day_of_the_week**: Indicates if the order was placed on a weekday or weekend.
- **rating**: Rating given by the customer (out of 5).
- **food_preparation_time**: Time taken (in minutes) for the restaurant to prepare the food.
- **delivery_time**: Time taken (in minutes) by the delivery person to deliver the order.

### Technical and Analytical Skills Demonstrated

1. **Data Importation and Handling**:
   - **Libraries Used**: Proficient use of **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data loading, transformation, and cleaning.
   - **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, converting data types, and applying category conversions to optimize storage.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - **Statistical Summary**: Utilization of Pandas `describe()` function to obtain key statistical insights on numerical variables (e.g., mean delivery time, distribution of order costs).
   - **Data Visualizations**: Leveraging **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to visualize distributions, frequencies, and trends:
     - Histograms and boxplots for continuous variables (e.g., order cost, preparation time, delivery time).
     - Bar plots for categorical data (e.g., cuisine type and day of the week).
   - **Univariate and Bivariate Analysis**:
     - Frequency distribution analysis of popular cuisines and order days.
     - Analysis of weekend vs. weekday order patterns.
     - Investigation of customer ratings and their impact on demand.

3. **Business Analysis and Insight Generation**:
   - **Demand Analysis**:
     - Identifying the top cuisines and busiest days for FoodHub to better prepare for peak demand.
     - Recognizing restaurants with the highest order volume to target for potential partnerships or promotions.
   - **Revenue and Cost Analysis**:
     - Calculation of net revenue generated based on order values and commission rates.
     - Analysis of average order costs by cuisine type to identify high-value cuisines.
   - **Operational Efficiency**:
     - Evaluation of food preparation and delivery times, including analysis of total delivery time.
     - Identifying differences in delivery efficiency between weekdays and weekends.

4. **Feature Engineering and Transformation**:
   - Creation of new columns, such as `total_delivery_time`, to analyze the complete time taken from food preparation to delivery.
   - Conversion of ratings from text (e.g., “Not given”) to numerical data types to enable further analysis.

5. **Business Insights and Recommendations**:
   - Identification of popular cuisines and restaurants to target for promotional offers.
   - Recommendations for inventory management and operational adjustments based on peak demand days.
   - Suggestions for potential expansion into high-demand cuisine types and under-served time slots.

6. **Conclusion and Recommendations**:
   - **Insights**: Summarized key findings, such as the higher demand on weekends, preference for American and Japanese cuisines, and longer delivery times on weekdays.
   - **Business Actions**: Provided actionable recommendations for FoodHub, including focusing on high-demand cuisines for promotions and investigating delivery efficiency improvements.

## 1. GUI Development with PyQt5

The script uses **PyQt5** to build an interactive graphical user interface (GUI), showcasing skills in:
- **GUI Layout Design**: Structuring the GUI components in a main window.
- **Event Handling**: Connecting buttons to specific functions that execute different parts of the data pipeline.
- **Widgets and Forms**: Using `QTableWidget` to display data tables and employing dialogs for file uploads and user prompts.
- **Error Handling and User Feedback**: Using message boxes to display errors and instructions, improving the user experience.

**Skill:** GUI programming, user interaction design, error handling in a GUI application.

## 2. Data Handling and Manipulation

The script makes extensive use of **pandas** and **NumPy** to read, manipulate, and preprocess data:
- **Data Import and Preview**: Loading CSV files into a pandas DataFrame and displaying previews of the data.
- **Column Operations**: Scaling numeric columns and selectively dropping or transforming columns.
- **Copying and Filtering**: Creating and manipulating DataFrame copies to isolate columns, handle outliers, and filter rows.

**Skill:** Data loading, cleaning, and manipulation in Python with pandas and NumPy.

---

## 3. Data Preprocessing

The script demonstrates several essential data preprocessing techniques for machine learning:
- **Scaling and Normalization**: Using `RobustScaler` from `scikit-learn` to scale numeric columns, standardizing the dataset.
- **Outlier Detection and Removal**: Using interquartile range (IQR) methods to detect and remove outliers.
- **Data Splitting**: Creating training, validation, and test splits to avoid overfitting and ensure model generalization.

**Skill:** Feature engineering, data preprocessing for machine learning, handling of imbalanced datasets.

---

## 4. Class Imbalance Handling

The script incorporates **imbalanced-learn** techniques to handle imbalanced datasets:
- **Random Oversampling and Undersampling**: Allowing users to balance class distributions in the training data, a critical skill when dealing with skewed data.

**Skill:** Handling class imbalance, using oversampling and undersampling techniques with imbalanced-learn.

---

## 5. Machine Learning Model Training and Evaluation

The script displays skills in implementing and evaluating a variety of **classification algorithms**:
- **Model Training**: Training multiple models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, SVM, and more).
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using `GridSearchCV` to perform hyperparameter tuning on each model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Calculating precision, recall, F1-score, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) to assess model performance.
- **Clustering Algorithms**: Implementing unsupervised methods (KMeans, DBSCAN, and One-Class SVM) for exploratory analysis.

**Skill:** Machine learning model training, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation metrics calculation, implementing clustering algorithms.

---

## 6. Visualization of Results

The script uses **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to visualize model performance:
- **Confusion Matrix Visualization**: Displaying a confusion matrix as a heatmap to visualize prediction results.
- **ROC and Precision-Recall Curves**: Generating plots to illustrate the trade-offs between precision, recall, and false positive rates.

**Skill:** Data visualization for model evaluation, creating informative charts for performance analysis.

---

## 7. Model Management and Ensemble Techniques

The script demonstrates proficiency with ensemble modeling techniques:
- **Voting and Stacking Classifiers**: Combining multiple models to improve prediction accuracy and robustness.
- **Label Propagation**: Semi-supervised learning to predict labels for unlabeled data.

**Skill:** Advanced machine learning, ensemble methods, semi-supervised learning.

---

## 8. Error Logging and Debugging

The script incorporates **logging** to keep track of errors:
- **Error Logging with Pythonâ€™s Logging Module**: Errors are logged to a file (`msc_project_error_Main_class.log`), which allows developers to identify and debug issues without interrupting the user experience.

**Skill:** Error logging, debugging, enhancing software reliability.

---

## 9. Modular and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

The script demonstrates **object-oriented programming** (OOP) principles and modular code structure:
- **Class-Based Structure**: The GUI and its functionalities are encapsulated in a `Main` class, promoting reuse and separation of concerns.
- **Encapsulation**: Ensuring that each class manages its own data and behavior, keeping related functionalities together.
- **Method Organization**: Breaking down functionalities into methods, making the code modular, reusable, and easy to maintain.
- **Inheritance**: Inheriting properties from `QMainWindow` and `Ui_MainWindow` in PyQt5 to create a custom `Main` class, showcasing inheritance in Python.

**Skill:** Object-oriented programming, encapsulation, inheritance, code modularity, and maintainability.

## 10. Core Python Skills

The script demonstrates a solid foundation in **core Python** skills:
- **File Handling**: Using `QFileDialog` to allow users to upload files and `pandas` for reading CSV data.
- **Exception Handling**: Using `try-except` blocks for error handling in data processing and logging error messages with custom descriptions.
- **List and Dictionary Operations**: Utilizing lists and dictionaries for storing results, including metrics for each model.
- **String Manipulation**: Formatting strings for logging and displaying user messages.
- **Numpy Array Operations**: Using `NumPy` arrays for efficient mathematical operations and array transformations.

**Skill:** Proficiency with Python fundamentals such as exception handling, file operations, data structures (lists, dictionaries), string formatting, and numpy for scientific computing.

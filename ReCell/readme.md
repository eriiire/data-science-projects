### Objectives

The objective of this project is to analyze the data provided and build a linear regression model to predict the price of a used phone and identify the factors that significantly influence it.

### Data Description

The data contains attributes of used/refurbished phones. Below is a detailed description of each field:

- **brand_name**: Name of the phone's manufacturing brand.
- **os**: Operating system on which the phone runs.
- **screen_size**: Screen size in centimeters.
- **4g**: Binary field indicating whether 4G connectivity is available.
- **5g**: Binary field indicating whether 5G connectivity is available.
- **main_camera_mp**: Resolution of the rear (main) camera in megapixels.
- **selfie_camera_mp**: Resolution of the front (selfie) camera in megapixels.
- **int_memory**: Amount of internal memory (ROM) in gigabytes.
- **ram**: Amount of RAM in gigabytes.
- **battery**: Battery capacity in milliampere hours (mAh).
- **weight**: Weight of the phone in grams.
- **release_year**: Year the phone model was released.
- **days_used**: Number of days the used/refurbished phone has been in use.
- **new_price**: Price of a new phone of the same model, in euros.
- **used_price**: Price of the used or refurbished phone, in euros.

### Technical and Analytical Skills Demonstrated

1. **Data Importation and Handling**:
   - **Libraries**: Expert use of **Pandas** and **NumPy** for importing, cleaning, and manipulating datasets. These libraries are widely used in data science and demonstrate strong capabilities in:
     - Data loading, inspection, and manipulation (e.g., filtering, grouping, and merging datasets).
     - Handling missing data, performing transformations, and preparing datasets for analysis.
     - Managing large datasets efficiently using vectorized operations.
   
2. **Data Visualization**:
   - **Visualization Tools**: Experience with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for creating compelling visualizations that help reveal data insights. Specific skills include:
     - Designing a range of visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, regression plots, etc.) to explore data distributions and relationships between variables.
     - Using **Seaborn's** built-in functions to generate publication-quality plots with a consistent aesthetic, improving readability and insight communication.
     - Customizing visual elements such as labels, colors, and plot styles for better clarity.

3. **Statistical and Machine Learning Models**:
   - **Linear Regression**: Proficiency in implementing linear regression models using:
     - **Scikit-learn** for building and validating models with train-test splitting and performance metrics. This shows practical knowledge in using popular machine learning frameworks to fit predictive models.
     - **Statsmodels**, which provides deeper insight into regression analysis, allowing for the interpretation of coefficients, p-values, and other statistical properties of the model.
   - **Model Evaluation**: Strong understanding of key performance metrics:
     - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** for measuring prediction accuracy.
     - **R-squared (RÂ²)** as a measure of model goodness-of-fit, demonstrating the ability to interpret results for regression models.

4. **Model Evaluation and Diagnostics**:
   - Application of robust model diagnostics through **Statsmodels**, ensuring the statistical soundness of models by checking assumptions and understanding relationships between variables.
   - Familiarity with both statistical and machine learning approaches to regression models, enabling flexible use of techniques depending on the problem context.

5. **Coding Best Practices**:
   - **Code Structuring**: Demonstrated ability to write clean and modular code, enhancing readability and maintainability. Adopting practices such as:
     - Consistent use of comments to explain code logic, aiding future code reviews or collaboration with teams.
     - Implementing clear and organized code blocks for preprocessing, modeling, and visualization steps, ensuring logical progression.
     - Consideration of code efficiency, particularly in the use of vectorized operations in Pandas and NumPy for large datasets.

6. **Markdown Documentation**:
   - **Documentation and Communication**: Effective use of **Markdown** within the Jupyter notebook to clearly communicate the structure, findings, and purpose of the analysis. This includes:
     - Descriptive section headings and well-structured explanations, allowing readers to follow the analysis intuitively.
     - Providing context for each step, from data overview to model evaluation, enhancing the notebook's value as a professional tool for sharing analysis.

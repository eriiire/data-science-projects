# Instructions for Running the UK Transport Data Analysis Project

This project is organized into two Jupyter Notebooks that need to be run sequentially. Each notebook addresses a different part of the analysis.

## Steps

1. **Start with the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Statistical Analysis Notebook**:
   - Open the notebook titled **"UK Transport Data Analysis - EDA and Statistics"**.
   - This notebook performs initial data exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis.
   - The outputs generated here will inform the model-building process in the next notebook.

2. **Proceed to the Model Building and Prediction Notebook**:
   - After completing the EDA, open the notebook titled **"UK Transport Data Analysis - Model Building and Predictions"**.
   - This notebook uses the insights gained from the EDA to build predictive models.
   - Ensure any outputs required from the first notebook are correctly loaded or referenced here.

## Data Files
Due to the large size of the dataset, it is stored externally. Please download the dataset from the provided links and ensure it is accessible before running the notebooks.

By following these steps, you will conduct a full data analysis and model-building workflow to gain insights and predictive capabilities for UK transportation data.
